# Examining historical reliability? Comparison of modelled MSSM survey indices to the MSSM design, SYN WCVI, and CPUE 3CD

The MSSM is the longest running groundfish survey on the BC coast, therefore it is important to understand how well the historical data capture trends in species abundances.
We compared the modelled MSSM survey indices to the MSSM design-based indices, modelled SYN WCVI (predicted on the SYN WCVI 2 x 2 km grid and the MSSM 3 x 3 km grid) indices, and the modelled CPUE 3CD indices.

## Comparison of modelled and design-based indices of abundance

<!-- TODO how was the design-based index calculated -->
The design-based index is calculated as the weighted mean of _____ OG synoptic report?.

However, the change in survey locations over time (e.g., Figure \@ref(fig:spatial-shift)) means that a modelled approach, which accounts for spatially correlated effects, may be a better approach than a design-based index.

Trends in each species index were similar between in both the modelled and the design based MSSM indices, however for most species the design-based has more variable mean annual estimates compared with the modelled index (Figure \@ref(fig:mssm-model-design)).
Trends in Yellowtail Rockfish, Bocaccio, Canary Rockfish, and Redstripe Rockfish have the greatest deviations from their repsective modelled indices.

For species where models did not converge we present the design-based index (Figure \@ref(fig:design-indices)).

<!-- QUESTION: Too similar to the synoptic caption? -->
(ref:model-design-indices) Comparison of modelled (green line) and design-based (pink open circles) indices from the MSSM survey.
Time-series with a solid trend line and shaded ribbon for 95% confidence intervals represent an index that has been standardized with a spatiotemporal model.
Pink open circles represent design-based mean estimates of relative biomass and vertical lines around the dots represent 95% bootstrap confidence intervals.
Vertical axes are scaled between zero and the maximum upper confidence interval value of the modelled index.
Then they two indices have been scaled to have the same geometric mean.
The axes are set to encompass the model-based confidence intervals.
<!-- KEEP the mean CV & number of sets??? -->
<!--
'Mean CV' is the mean of the annual coefficients of variation (CVs) for the modelled (M) and design-based (D) indices.
'Mean $+$ve sets' indicates the ratio of the mean number (across the years) of sets that captured the species of interest to the mean number of sets.

The modelled index was predicted on 3 x 3 km grid (Figure \@ref(fig:prediction-grid)).

### Comparison of MSSM to other survey indices in the same region

- The MSSM index is generally more variable than the CPUE 3CD and SYN WCVI indices.
- The modelled MSSM index is most congruent with the SYN WCVI index that is predicted on the 3 x 3 km MSSM grid. (Figure - zoom-in; \@ref(fig:rolling-window-correlation))
- This is likely because the distribution of sampled depths in the the MSSM survey (81--219 m) are shallower than SYN WCVI samples areas deeper (43--803 m). (Figure \@ref(fig:depth-dist))


- The depths sampled in these surveys have been consistent over time. (needed?)


- We compared the modelled MSSM index with the modelled SYN WCVI index when predicted over the full grid of the SYN WCVI and when constrained to the same grid used for the MSSM index.


- We checked whether the correlation between the different survey indices declined as we went further back in time. We compared a 10-year rolling window correlation between the MSSM ~ CPUE 3CD, the MSSM ~ SYN WCVI, and the MSSM ~ SYN WCVI predicted on the MSSM grid.

<!-- TODO: wrong .png (fig doesn't exist?) -->

There was no systematic decrease in correlation between the different indices earlier in the time-series (Figure \@ref(fig:rolling-window-correlation)).


### Sampling differences between MSSM and SYN WCVI

Twenty-four species have length samples in both the MSSM and SYN WCVI. Longer specimens tend to be sampled in the SYN WCVI compared to the MSSM (Figure \@ref(fig:))

There was also no relationship between the

Modelled MSSM ~ Modelled SYN WCVI (over MSSM only grid)

Modelled MSSM ~ CPUE 3CD

Modelled MSSM 2km grid ~ 3km grid

- 3km grid is less patchy
- results from the 2km grid were similar to the 3km grid --> even worth including this note?
