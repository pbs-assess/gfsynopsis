Since 1973, DFO has conducted the Multi-Species Small-Mesh Survey, which is one of the longest continuous bottom trawl time-series for groundfish off the coast of West Coast Vancouver Island.
The survey was designed to collect data to assess stock status of Pink shrimp (*Pandalus jordanii*) populations.
