Title? Assessing the quality of groundfish population indices derived from the Multispecies Small Mesh Survey (the 'shrimp survey')

# Introduction

DFO has conducted annual surveys at fixed stations in shrimp grounds off West Coast Vancouver Island since 1973.
This survey was designed to collect data to assess stock status of Pink shrimp (*Pandalus jordani*) populations, but it is now a multi-species survey, and is one of the longest continuous bottom trawl time-series for groundfish off the coast of WCVI.

However, the survey has undergone several changes that likely affect interpretation of the data.
In this report we:

(1) Highlight changes that may affect interpretation of the groundfish data (e.g., gear used, sampling protocols, species identification)
(2) Fit geostatistical models to account for changes in spatial sampling through time
(3) Understand how well historical MSSM groundfish data may represent trends in abundance by comparing modelled MSSM indices with indices from two other indices in the same region (CPUE 3CD and SYN WCVI)

Data for the MSSM is found in GFBio and is publicly available on the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) for years up to 2022 (@mssm2022obis).

In this report we used data extracted from GFBio for years 1975 - 2022.

# Summary of changes to MSSM survey

## Survey timing and area

The MSSM is typically conducted in the last week of April to the first weeks of May. With the exception of late surveys in 1985 and 1987 (Table \@ref(tab:change-table)).
In 1977 and 1978, additional surveys were conducted in September on commercial vessels, but these have been excluded from this report.

To derive an area-weighted biomass index for the MSSM, we created a 3 $\times$ 3 km grid covering the extent of all survey locations in WCVI Shrimp Survey Areas 124 and 125.
Any grid cell that intersected with more than one survey location was retained.
In this report, we used a subset of the grid cells that were last sampled between 2009 to 2021 (Figure \@ref(fig:prediction-grid)).
This time period covered the most consistently sampled locations in recent years.
In 2022, additional stations that were infrequently or not sampled since 1975 were sampled and so these grid cells were not used to estimate a biomass index.

```{r prediction-grid, fig.cap="Prediction grid used to calculate biomass indices for the Multispecies Small-Mesh Bottom Trawl Survey (MSSM). Grid cells are 3x3 km and cover all sampling locations between 2009-2019. Points (grey) indicate sampling locations, with points in black representing locations sampled between 2009-2019. Depth contours are shown at 100 m, 200 m, 500 m, and 1000 m.", fig.show='hold', out.width="3.5in"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("report/mssm-tech-report/figure/grid-prediction-2009.png"), dpi = NA)

```

The MSSM is a fixed station survey (Rutherford et al. in prep), with transects run in an east-west direction. Over the years, the extent of the survey has decreased (Figure \@ref(fig:historical-grid)). In part this is likely because in early years, when shrimp were caught near the east or west boundaries of the survey area, additional trawls would be carried out further in this direction until shrimp stopped being caught. In 2022 sampling was extended eastward and northward to cover the original extent better than any year since 1975 (Figure \@ref(fig:spatial-shift)).

```{r historical-grid, fig.cap="Grid coverage based on the last year prior to 2019 that a grid cell was last sampled. Darker shades indicate more recent years and correspond to changes in navigation systems (1979 and 1998). Depth contours are shown at 100 m, 200 m, 500 m, and 1000 m.", out.width="3.5in"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("report/mssm-tech-report/figure/grid-historical-nav-changes_no-points.png"), dpi = NA)

```

The navigation system used in the MSSM survey has changed twice, once in 1979 from Loran A to Loran C, and again in 1998 from Loran C to the Global Positioning System (GPS) (Figure \@ref(fig:historical-grid)).
Improved accuracy of GPS means that early survey locations may therefore be more variable.
As a consequence of more accurate positioning, Sinclair et al. (\@sinclair2001pcod) found that there was a trend in distance travelled over time with shorter distances travelled for the 30 minute tows in the MSSM survey.

Between 1975 and 1977, there was a noticeable shift in sampling locations relative to subsequent years (Figure \@ref(fig:spatial-shift)).
It is possible that this reflects surveys used to establish the extent of the shrimping grounds (personal communication, TODO). (JD: I don't think this is the case after reading the 1975 and 1976 cruise reports, or at least there is no mention of change in protocol.)
This could also be the result of using the less accurate Loran A navigation system.

```


## Gear changes

Gear changes occurred in 1977, 2006, 2007, and 2011 (Table \@ref(tab:change-table)).
In 1977, the net, foot rope, and doors were changed.
A series of calibration tows was done in 1976
The 70 foot semi-balloon shrimp net was replaced with the National Marine Fisheries Science (NMFS) 61 foot shrimp trawl net (Rutherford et al. in prep).
No calibration tows were performed but it has found that the NMFS net was 1.4 more efficient than the 70 foot semi-balloon net (Boutillier et al. 1976), meaning that catch weights in the first years of the survey are likely to be biased down relative to 1977 onward.
In our analysis we did not account for this change in gear in 1977.

In 2006, the NMFS net was replaced with a 61 foot American shrimp trawl net (Table \@ref(tab:change-table)).
However, only two comparable sets of tows were collected (see Table 2 and 3 in Rutherford et al. in prep).
With insufficient data to include the gear change in the model, we instead present a visual comparison of the mean catch of the two comparative tows done in 2006 (Figure \@ref(fig:net-comp)).
In these two tows, there were three species not caught in the NMFS net and seven species not caught in American net.
The mean catch of these species was less than 10 kg in the net that did catch them.


```{r net-comp, fig.cap="Mean catch of species caught in two sets of comparative sets of gear in 2006. The 61 foot National Marine Fisheries Service (NFMS) net was used between 1977-2005 and the 61 foot American shrimp trawl net has been used from 2006-present. Only two sets of comparison trawls were done with each net at two locations in 2006. ", out.width="60%"}

```


## Catch sorting and sampling

```{r}
post_2003_spp <- readRDS(here::here("report/mssm-tech-report/data-outputs/post-2003-spp.rds"))
```

The most notable change to catch sorting and sampling occurred in 2003.
From 2003 to present, all species have been sorted and identified to the species or lowest taxonomic level (Rutherford et al. in prep).
Prior to 2003, `r length(post_2003_spp)` species had zero catch weights and catch counts.
Of these, six species are caught regularly: Big Skate, Sandpaper Skate, Longnose Skate, Blackbelly Eelpout, Stripetail Rockfish, and Slim Sculpin (Figure \@ref(fig:mean-catch-pre-post-2003)).

```{r mean-catch-pre-post-2003, fig.cap="Mean annual catch (kg) of fish species listed in this synoptic report that have been caught in the Multi-species small mesh survey. Grey shading highlights the period prior to full sorting and identification in 2003. The grey vertical line in 2001 indicates a change in sorting protocol where all sorting occurred below deck using a conveyor belt system (Rutherford et al. in prep).", out.width = "\\textwidth"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("report/mssm-tech-report/figure/sampling-2003.png"), dpi = NA)

```

To check if some species were identified at higher taxonomic levels prior to 2003, we extracted data from GFBio for higher order taxonomies of species that have been identified in the MSSM survey since 2003 (Figure \@ref(fig:spp-aggregate-plot)).
Sculpins and skates are the species that were counted at the family level prior to 2003. Whereas prior to 2003, flatfishes and rockfishes appear to be identified to species if they were counted/weighed.
The mean annual catch of all flatfishes identified to species was higher after from 2003 onward compared to years prior to 2003 (Figure \@ref(fig:spp-aggregate-plot)).
It was also higher in 2002 which may reflect the full catch being sorted below deck on the conveyor belt.
It is unknown whether this change in observed abundance was due to changes in sorting (which was systematic and counted all catch) or whether it reflects actual changes in abundances.

In 2002, abnormally high catches of 'Eelpouts' and 'Skates' were recorded relative to years before 2002 and when we aggregated species catches for post-2003 years (Figure \@ref(fig:spp-aggregate-plot)).
These outliers do not reflect a decimal error, duplicated data (there were three high 'Skate' sets in 2002) and it is unlikely that it is due to a mis-identification.
It is possible that these species aggregates were data entry errors (e.g., species coding error).

```{r spp-aggregate-plot, fig.cap="Mean annual catch (kg) of higher level taxonomic identifications of species that have been caught in the Multi-species small mesh survey. Grey shading highlights the period prior to full sorting and identification in 2003. The grey vertical line in 2001 indicates a change in sorting protocol where all sorting occurred below deck using a conveyor belt system (Rutherford et al. in prep).", out.width="\\textwidth"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("report/mssm-tech-report/figure/aggregated-id-level-plot.png"), dpi = NA)
```

Some species that were possibly misidentified prior to 2003 include:

- Stripetail Rockfish as Sharpchin Rockfish
- Yellowmouth as Pacific Ocean Perch
- Small Yelloweye may have been mixed in with Canary Rockfish
- Small Pacific Cod as Pacific Tomcod
- Petrale Sole as Flathead Sole (at all sizes that Flatheads are observed)

For example, recorded abundances of Pacific Tomcod decrease after 2003 and it is possible that this is because of mis-identified Pacific Cod prior to 2003.
However, the magnitude of this effect is relatively small, with annual catch sizes of Pacific Tomcod typically less than 5 kg/year.

# Estimating population indices with spatiotemporal models

We fit a spatiotemporal model to the MSSM data for all species that had a proportion of positive sets $\ge$ 5%.
For the six species that did not have catch weights before 2003, we calculated the proportion of positive sets for 2003 to present.
Of these species, only blackbelly eelpout met the 5% coverage threshold to be modelled.

<!-- TODO look at synoptic report methods -->
As was done in the 2023 Synoptic Report (ref TODO), we fit these models using a Tweedie distribution and used area swept as an offset.
In 2022, 64% of trawls (57 fishing events) did not have doorspread values and so for these fishing events we calculated the mean doorspread of 2022 and used this for the missing values.
Our spatiotemporal models had constant spatial random fields and a random walk spatiotemporal random fields.
Unlike the modelling of the synoptic trawl data, in cases where models did not converge, the spatial random field was turned off and only the spatiotmporal random field was modelled using a random walk.

We show results in the biomass index panels on the species pages and in this appendix if the models converged, the maximum estimated CIs were less than 10 $\times$ the maximum estimated biomass, and the mean coefficient of variation was less than 2.

# Examining historical reliability? Comparison of modelled MSSM survey indices to the MSSM design, SYN WCVI, and CPUE 3CD

The MSSM is the longest running groundfish survey on the BC coast, therefore it is important to understand how well the historical data capture trends in species abundances.
We compared the modelled MSSM survey indices to the MSSM design-based indices, modelled SYN WCVI (predicted on the SYN WCVI 2 x 2 km grid and the MSSM 3 x 3 km grid) indices, and the modelled CPUE 3CD indices.
In this appendix, where we compare the trends between different biomass indices and multiple indices are plotted on the same graph, they have been scaled to the geometric mean of estimated biomass in the years that the series overlap.


## Comparison of modelled and design-based indices of abundance

<!-- TODO how was the design-based index calculated -->
The design-based index is calculated _______.

However, the change in survey locations over time (e.g., Figure \@ref(fig:spatial-shift)) means that a modelled approach, which accounts for spatially correlated effects, may be a better approach than a design-based index.

Trends in each species index were similar between in both the modelled and the design based MSSM indices, however for most species the design-based is more variable than the modelled index (Figure \@ref(fig:mssm-model-design)).

For some species we present only a design-based index, because models did not converge.

<!-- QUESTION: Too similar to the synoptic caption? -->
(ref:model-design-indices) Comparison of modelled (green line) and design-based (pink open circles) indices from the MSSM survey.
Time-series with a solid trend line and shaded ribbon for 95% confidence intervals represent an index that has been standardized with a spatiotemporal model.
Pink open circles represent design-based mean estimates of relative biomass and vertical lines around the dots represent 95% bootstrap confidence intervals.
Vertical axes are scaled between zero and the maximum upper confidence interval value of the modelled index.
Then they two indices have been scaled to have the same geometric mean.
The axes are set to encompass the model-based confidence intervals.
<!-- KEEP the mean CV & number of sets??? -->
<!--
'Mean CV' is the mean of the annual coefficients of variation (CVs) for the modelled (M) and design-based (D) indices.
'Mean $+$ve sets' indicates the ratio of the mean number (across the years) of sets that captured the species of interest to the mean number of sets.
-->
The modelled index was predicted on 3 x 3 km grid (Figure \@ref(fig:prediction-grid)).

### Comparison of MSSM to other survey indices in the same region

- The MSSM index is generally more variable than the CPUE 3CD and SYN WCVI indices.
- The modelled MSSM index is most congruent with the SYN WCVI index that is predicted on the 3 x 3 km MSSM grid. (Figure - zoom-in; \@ref(fig:rolling-window-correlation))
- This is likely because the distribution of sampled depths in the the MSSM survey (81--219 m) are shallower than SYN WCVI samples areas deeper (43--803 m). (Figure \@ref(fig:depth-dist))


- The depths sampled in these surveys have been consistent over time. (needed?)


- We compared the modelled MSSM index with the modelled SYN WCVI index when predicted over the full grid of the SYN WCVI and when constrained to the same grid used for the MSSM index.


- We checked whether the correlation between the different survey indices declined as we went further back in time. We compared a 10-year rolling window correlation between the MSSM ~ CPUE 3CD, the MSSM ~ SYN WCVI, and the MSSM ~ SYN WCVI predicted on the MSSM grid.

<!-- TODO: wrong .png (fig doesn't exist?) -->

There was no systematic decrease in correlation between the different indices earlier in the time-series (Figure \@ref(fig:rolling-window-correlation)).


### Sampling differences between MSSM and SYN WCVI

Twenty-four species have length samples in both the MSSM and SYN WCVI. Longer specimens tend to be sampled in the SYN WCVI compared to the MSSM (Figure \@ref(fig:))

There was also no relationship between the
