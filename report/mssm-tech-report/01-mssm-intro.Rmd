Title? Assessing the quality of groundfish population indices derived from the Multispecies Small Mesh Survey (the 'shrimp survey')

# Introduction

DFO has conducted annual surveys at fixed stations in shrimp grounds off West Coast Vancouver Island since 1973.
This survey was designed to collect data to assess stock status of Pink shrimp (*Pandalus jordani*) populations, but it is now a multi-species survey, and is one of the longest continuous bottom trawl time-series for groundfish off the coast of WCVI.

However, the survey has undergone several changes that likely affect interpretation of the data.
In this report we:

(1) Highlight changes that may affect interpretation of the groundfish data (e.g., gear used, sampling protocols, species identification)
(2) Fit geostatistical models to account for changes in spatial sampling through time
(3) Understand how well historical MSSM groundfish data may represent trends in abundance by comparing modelled MSSM indices with indices from two other indices in the same region (CPUE 3CD and SYN WCVI)

Data for the MSSM is found in GFBio and is publicly available on the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) for years up to 2022 (@mssm2022obis).

In this report we used data extracted from GFBio for years 1975 - 2022.
