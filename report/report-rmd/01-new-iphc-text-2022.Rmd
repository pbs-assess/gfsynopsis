Andy adding new text regarding IPHC survey here, to then go into Analysis and
response section (since figures don't currently build for him):

For the IPHC survey, the data are updated to include 2019, 2020, and 2021
(Table \@ref(tab:IPHCdata)). The data are available at different resolutions and
spatial scales due to the survey design. The methods (and some of the data) have been moved
from the gfplot package to a new one, gfiphc [@edwards2022gfiphc] TODO.

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\caption{Summary of available data from the IPHC stock assessment longline
surveys, updating Table~G.1 from [@anderson2019synopsis] TODO. 'Data resolution'
indicates at what level the data are available, and
'WCVI?' indicates whether or not the survey included locations off the west
coast of Vancouver Island. 'Location of data' indicates where the data now
reside (all earlier data on spreadsheets are now in gfiphc).}

Methods are unchanged from those described in [@anderson2019synopsis], except
for the following:

1. In 2018 there were 131 new expansion stations that had not been
previously surveyed. These new stations, plus six further new ones in 2021, are
excluded from the time-series calculations; they were originally indavertently
included for 2018 in the calculations and maps in @anderson2019synopsis. TODO: check if
include in new maps or not. Best not to as some may be outside of current
gfsynopsis plotting region.
<!-- iphc-2020-data.pdf and iphc-2021-data.pdf in gfiphc have details-->

2. In 2020 fishing was mostly in July and August, whereas it is usually May to
August; this is not accounted for in the methods.

3. The bootstrapping methods use 10,000 bootstrap samples instead of 1000, as it
made a difference for some species.

4. For 2021 the waters off the WCVI were surveyed, but only a subsample of
stations were surveyed. This does not affect the calculations for the waters
north of Vancouver Island (Series A, B, and AB in @anderson2019synopsis),
but do affect the calculations for the full coast (Series D and CD). This can
slightly affect the determination of whether or not Series AB (usually the
longest series that can be constructed, as shown in the results here) can be
considered representative of the full coast. Newer methods are being developed
that will deal with such subsampling, as well as include hook competition.

5. Also for 2021 there were six new stations that have never been surveyed
before. We declare these as non-standard in for constructing the various
Series, since they do not appear in previous years. Five stations are along the
Alaskan border, extending further north than ever before, and the sixth is just
outside the Scott Islands Rockfish Conservation Area off the northwest tip of
Vancouver Island. <!-- See iphc-2021-data.pdf for maps and further details.-->

Further technical details are given in gfiphc [@edwards2021gfiphc], which also
includes details for further analysing data for individual species, groups of
species, and restricted areas.
