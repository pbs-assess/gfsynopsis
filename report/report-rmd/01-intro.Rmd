# INTRODUCTION {#sec:intro}

The combination of fishery-dependent data, such as catch and effort, and
fishery-independent survey data, such as biomass indices and age
compositions, form the backbone of most fisheries stock assessment.
Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) at the Pacific Biological Station
(PBS) in Nanaimo, British Columbia (BC), manages vast quantities of such data on
groundfish species in BC. However, there is not the capacity
to conduct formal stock assessments for most stocks annually, and therefore,
much of these data are not summarised to represent the nature of the data
holdings.

As one step to address this issue, we have created this data synopsis
report to give a snapshot of long-term and recent population and fishing
trends, as well as data availability, for all major BC groundfish
species of commercial and conservation interest. The report is an
extension of the data scorecard concept discussed at a Canadian Science
Advisory Secretariat (CSAS) Regional Peer Review Meeting in May 2016
[@macdougall2016]. The report is published here as a CSAS Research Document to 
facilitate review of the methods, and we intend to update the report annually or
biennially (excluding any unchanged methods). The report
generation is fully automated --- pulling data from databases, fitting models,
generating visualizations, and stitching the document together to facilitate
rapid publication, reproducibility, and transparency.

Our goals with this report are to (1) facilitate regular review by groundfish
scientists and managers of trends in survey indices and stock composition
across all species to provide information for discussion on assessment
priorities; (2) generate standardized datasets, biological model fits,
and visualizations that will help assessment scientists develop operating
models and select candidate management procedures for groundfish stocks; and
(3) increase data transparency between DFO, the fishing
industry, First Nations, non-governmental organizations, and the general
public. We provide guidance on the limits to application of the methods and
summaries in the report (Section \@ref(sec:caveats)).

## REPORT STRUCTURE

```{r n_species}
.spp <- gfsynopsis::get_spp_names()
no_species <- nrow(.spp)
```

The main results of this synopsis report are presented in two-page
species-by-species subsections that visually synthesize most available data for
each species (Section \@ref(sec:synopsis-plots)). The report covers `r no_species`
groundfish species that are either of commercial, recreational, conservation, or First
Nations interest, or are regularly caught in our research surveys. The report
focuses on the surveys and data types applicable to the widest array of these
species.

Each set of pages for a single species is laid out in the same way. The page
layout starts with the species common name, the species scientific name,
and the DFO species code, which usually corresponds to the page number
referencing the species in @hart1988. The figures themselves are laid out such
that the first page has survey (Figure \@ref(fig:intro-maps)) time series
trends and spatial patterns on the left and commercial time series by Pacific
Marine Fisheries Commission areas (Figure \@ref(fig:management-map)) and
spatial patterns on the right. The second page is focused on biological samples
from both fishery dependent and independent sources. This page begins at the
top with length and age data and their relationship with each other, then shows
data on maturity, and finishes with an overview of available numbers of sampled
fish across all survey and commercial samples for various biological
measurements.

In terms of surveys, we have focused on the Synoptic Bottom Trawl surveys, the
Outside Hard Bottom Long Line (HBLL) surveys (alternatively referred to as the
Pacific Halibut Management Association, PHMA, surveys) (Figure
\@ref(fig:intro-maps)), and the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC)
Fishery Independent Setline surveys, because these provide the greatest spatial
and taxonomic coverage of the species in this report. Survey biomass index
trends are also shown for the Hecate Strait Multispecies Assemblage (MSA HS)
survey and the Inside HBLL survey. As an example, we
are not showing biomass index trends or maps from the Sablefish trap surveys,
since these are highly selective for Sablefish. However, we do include counts
of available fish specimens from biological samples on all surveys and fit
biological models such as growth models to all available data. A brief
description of the included surveys is included in Appendix
\@ref(app:survey-trend-models) along with associated references for detailed
survey descriptions and designs. A table of other surveys conducted by DFO that
are not included in this report but may be applicable for some species-specific
analyses is also given in Appendix \@ref(app:survey-trend-models).

Hard Bottom Long Line survey boundaries (right). The colours match the colour
coding through the rest of the report. The coverage of the International
Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) survey is displayed on the IPHC survey
catch rate plots as all of the individual stations fished.

In navigating the report, we suggest that the report is best viewed in a PDF
two-page view so that all the plots for a single species can be viewed at once.
We also note that the Table of Contents, index pages, figures references, and
citations are clickable hyperlinks to facilitate navigation.

We made a number of overarching design decisions in structuring the
report:

1. Each species is displayed with the same layout to facilitate finding a type
   of data, comparing species, and identifying missing data via empty plots.

1. We have limited the report to two pages per species so that all plots can be
   laid out at once on a screen in a PDF. The data presentation is dense, but
   we believe there is value in being able to examine all the data for
   a species at once.

1. The colours representing the various surveys are held constant to facilitate
   tracing a single survey throughout the plots.

1. The colour scales are consistent for the survey maps and survey biological
   specimen number plots and for the commercial CPUE maps and commercial
   biological specimen number plots (the bottom plots on both pages).

1. Data on female fish are always shown in front of data on male fish and are
   either coloured or black whereas males are always indicated with light grey.

1. The chosen continuous colour schemes are colour-blind proof and readable when
   printed in grey scale.

## CAVEATS {#sec:caveats}

There are many caveats when interpreting this report.

1. The outputs in this report are not a substitute for stock assessment. For
   example, although relative biomass index trends from surveys indicate the
   biomass trend for a species in an area, such information is best combined
   with other information such as removals by commercial catches and
   information on the age- or length-composition of the stock to make
   conclusions about the status of a stock.

1. Biomass indices from trawl or longline surveys and commercial CPUE indices
   need careful interpretation on a stock-by-stock basis. We have attempted to
   flag survey index trends that may be especially suspect either because of
   high survey variability or because only a small fraction of trawl or
   longline sets contain the species, but this is not a guarantee in itself.
   Survey indices are not always representative of abundance for a variety of
   reasons, and a lack of data for a species does not necessarily indicate
   a small population --- the surveys may simply not be suitable for sampling
   that species. Furthermore, changes through time, including fish behavioural
   changes or range shifts, could result in biases through time even for
   well-sampled species.

1. Survey and commercial CPUE index trends do not resolve population scale and
   the outputs in this report do not resolve conflicts in trends drawn from
   different sources for the same species.

1. The outputs in this report are not appropriate for marine spatial planning.
   The data as presented are resolved at a coarse spatial scale and marine
   spatial planning uses require specific data treatments beyond the general
   approaches used in this report.

1. The commercial CPUE data should not be considered to be proportional to
   stock abundance for a multitude of reasons [e.g., @harley2001]. Nonetheless,
   we think there is value in transparently displaying the available data for
   all species.

1. The catch history reported here reflects recorded data and may not represent
   actual catches. The
   commercial catch presented here will not necessarily match reconstructed time
   series in stock assessments. Historical catch reconstructions require careful
   species-specific consideration and analysis. Furthermore, fluctuations in
   commercial catch, for example recent declines in species catch for Bocaccio
   and Yelloweye Rockfish, do not necessarily reflect declines in stock
   abundance and may be due to other factors including implementation of
   management measures (see map in Figure \@ref(fig:closures-map) of current
   fishery restriction initiatives in the Pacific Region).
   Reported discard weights are considered less reliable
   prior to 100% observer coverage of the bottom trawl fishery in 1996, and
   prior to fisheries integration in 2006 for the trap, hook and line, midwater
   trawl and Strait of Georgia (SoG) bottom trawl fisheries. The discards in
   the catch plot therefore only include bottom trawl discard weights from 1996
   to present and trap, hook and line, midwater trawl and SoG bottom trawl
   discard weights from 2006 to present.

1. It is not feasible for us to individually assess the results for all
   species in a detailed manner. To use the results for a particular species in
   future assessments, or to make other inferences, we recommend that users
   carefully examine the data and model results. Due to the necessary
   automation required to construct this report, not all species-specific
   special cases may have been fully considered.

## DATA ACCESSIBILITY

Data in this document are maintained by the Groundfish Data Unit at the Pacific
Biological Station in Nanaimo, British Columbia. Data accessibility and contact
details are described in Appendix \@ref(app:data).

## REPRODUCIBILITY

All of the data extraction, data manipulation, model fitting, and visualization
for this report is automated and reproducible. We developed the gfdata, gfplot 
and gfsynopsis R packages for this purpose. The gfdata package enables the data
extraction. The gfplot package performs the model fitting and visualizations. 
It is designed to be modular so it can be used in various capacities for other 
groundfish analyses (Figure \@ref(fig:gfplot-web)). The gfsynopsis package calls
functions from the gfplot and gfdata packages to generate this report. Appendix 
\@ref(app:reproducibility) provides further details on these packages and on the
computational environment needed to reproduce this report.

## UPDATE SCHEDULE

We intend to publish annual or biennial updates of this synopsis report ---
possibly as a Science Response document. These updates will include
another year or two of data and any important corrections to the data, text, or
visualizations. Data for each survey season will likely only be ready for
publication in the report by fall of the following year. On a less frequent
basis, we will consider making larger changes to the structure, methods, or
content of the report within the context of a CSAS reveiw process.
