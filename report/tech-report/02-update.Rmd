# Update {#sec:update}


## Analysis and Response

In this Science Response, all figure pages were rebuilt with updated data using the methods described in Anderson et al. (2019). Survey and commercial data from 2022 were added, and three species are now included: Eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus), Popeye (Coryphaenoides cinereus), and Shortbelly Rockfish (Sebastes jordani). We also now present length and age composition data for the Inside HBLL survey.

Additionally, data from the Multispecies Small-mesh Bottom Trawl Survey (MSSM) are now included (Rutherford et al. in prep) in the biomass indices and length composition data.

### Multispecies Small Mesh Groundfish Bottom Trawl (MSSM)

- MSSM information to cite: Rutherford et al. (in prep - hopefully end of 2023)
- An annual small mesh multi-species survey at fixed stations in shrimp grounds off West Coast - Vancouver Island.
- First surveyed in 1973, one of the longest continuous bottom trawl time series for groundfish off the coast of WCVI
- The survey typically occurs in late April to May, with exceptions in 1985 (May 24 - June 7) and in 1987 (August 4 - 14).
- Since 1973, changes to the fishing gear used and catch sorting may affect interpretation of the data (See Rutherford et al. in prep?).
  + Trawl nets changed in 1976, 2005, and 2006.
  + Catch sorting -
    * From 1973 - 1976, large species weights were estimated using random sampling
    * Since 1978 large fish were sorted and weighed
    * since 2001 all species, including small species were sorted and weighed

### Spatial modelling
A notable update to this report compared to the 2022 Science Response is the addition of ‘stitched’ biomass indices. For each set of survey types (Synoptic Bottom Trawl (SYN), Outside Hard Bottom Long Line (HBLL), Inside HBLL, and IPHC Fishery-Independent Setline Survey (IPHC FISS), a geostatistical model (Appendix?) was used to estimate a biomass index across the survey domain of these surveys. This was done when the total proportion of positive sets was > 5%.

For the IPHC FISS, the spatial grid of sampling stations from 2017 was used for predictions. The grid from 2017 represents a standard sampling grid, which matches the survey domain of the majority of the IPHC FISS data (e.g., unlike the 2018 expansion year). Similar to the IPHC design-based index only stations declared as usable and standard (REF?)

Geostatistical survey indices have been included as separate panels in the Survey biomass index plots (Figure X).


### IPHC update
The methods for calculating the IPHC design-based index remain unchanged from those described in Anderson et al. (2019) and (DFO 2022 - Synopsis), except for the following:

1. Species identification has improved over time for some species. For example, the average catch rate of ‘Unidentified Skates’ was almost 1 fish per effective skate from 1995–1999, but then declined to near zero because Big Skate and Longnose Skate were both explicitly identified from 1998 onwards. The more rarely caught Aleutian Skate and Sandpaper Skate only shows up in the data from 2006 onwards. Such changes in protocol can be the cause of zero counts early in the time series for some species and so these data points have been omitted. See [HG predator analysis vignette](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/pbs-assess/gfiphc/blob/master/vignettes/analysis_for_HG_herring_predators.html). Similarly the Shortspine Thornyhead only shows up in the data in 1998 and was likely classified under ‘Unidentified Thornyhead (idiot).

2. Similar to 2021, in 2022 waters off the WCVI were surveyed but only for a subsample of stations. This may affect the determination of whether or not Series AB can be considered representative of the full coast and is one reason why a modelled-based index may be preferable.

Erratum: 2022 report Survey Biomass Maps for the Synoptic Bottom Trawl Surveys displayed data and model estimates for 2018 and 2019 rather than 2020 and 2021.
