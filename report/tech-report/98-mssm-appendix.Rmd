# Multispecies Small-Mesh Bottom Trawl Survey (MSSM) {#app:mssm}

The MSSM is typically conducted in the last week of April to the first weeks of May. With the exception of late surveys in 1985 and 1987 (Table \@ref(tab:change-table)). In 1977 and 1978, additional surveys were conducted in September on commercial vessels, but these have been excluded from this report.


## Survey area

To derive an area-weighted biomass index for the MSSM, we created a 3 $\times$ 3 km grid covering the extent of all survey locations in WCVI Shrimp Survey Areas 124 and 125.
Any grid cell that intersected with more than one survey location was retained.
In this report, we used a subset of the grid cells that were last sampled between 2009 to 2019 (Figure \@ref(fig:prediction-grid)).
This time period covered the most consistently sampled locations in recent years.
In 2022, additional stations that were infrequently or not sampled since 1975 were sampled and so these grid cells were not used to estimate a biomass index.

Between 1975 and 1977, there was a noticeable shift in sampling locations relative to subsequent years (Figure \@ref(fig:spatial-shift)).
It is possible that this reflects surveys used to establish the extent of the shrimping grounds (personal communication, TODO).

```{r prediction-grid, fig.cap="Prediction grid used to calculate biomass indices for the Multispecies Small-Mesh Bottom Trawl Survey (MSSM). Grid cells are 3x3 km and cover all sampling locations between 2009-2019. Points (grey) indicate sampling locations, with points in black representing locations sampled between 2009-2019.", fig.show='hold', out.width="3.5in"}

```

```{r spatial-shift, fig.cap="Shift in sampling locations (points) for select years from the start of the survey in 1975 to 2022. Grid cells are 2x2 km and cover all sampling locations between 2009-2019."}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("report/mssm-appendix/figures/grid-spatial-sampling-changes.png"), dpi = NA)
```

Although the MSSM is a fixed station survey (Rutherford et al. in prep), over the years, the extent of the survey has decreased (Figure \@ref(fig:historical-grid)).
However, in 2022 sampling extended eastward and northward to cover the original extent better than any year since 1975 (Figure \@ref(fig:spatial-shift)).

```{r historical-grid, fig.cap="Grid coverage based on the last year, prior to 2019, that a grid cell was last sampled. Darker shades indicate more recent years and correspond to changes in navigation systems (1979 and 1998).", out.width="3.5in"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("report/mssm-appendix/figures/grid-historical-nav-changes_no-points.png"), dpi = NA)

```

The navigation systems used in in the MSSM have changed twice, once in 1979 from Loran A to Loran C, and again in 1998 from Loran C to the Global Positioning System (GPS) (Figure \@ref(fig:historical-grid)).
Early survey locations may therefore be more variable.
It was also found that there was a trend in distance travelled over time with shorter distances travelled for the 30 minute tows once GPS was implemented (Sinclair et al 2001).

## Gear changes

Gear changes occurred in 1977, 2006, 2007, and 2011 (Table \@ref(tab:change-table)).
In 1977, the net, foot rope, and doors were changed.
The 70 foot semi-balloon shrimp net was replaced with the National Marine Fisheries Science (NMFS) 61 foot shrimp trawl net (Rutherford et al. in prep).
No calibration tows were performed but other research has found that the NMFS net was 1.4 more efficient than the 70 foot semi-balloon net (Boutillier et al. 1977, 1998 TODO), meaning that catch weights between 1973-1976 are likely to be biased down relative to 1977 onward.

```{r net-comp, fig.cap="Mean catch of species caught in two sets of comparative sets of gear in 2006. The 61 foot National Marine Fisheries Service (NFMS) net was used between 1977-2005 and the 61 foot American shrimp trawl net has been used from 2006-present. Only two sets of comparison trawls were done with each net at two locations in 2006. ", out.width="50%"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("report/mssm-appendix/figures/net-comp.png"), dpi = NA)

```

In 2006, the NMFS net was replaced with a 61 foot American shrimp trawl net (Table \@ref(tab:change-table)). However, only two comparable sets of tows were collected (Rutherford et al. in prep Table 2 and 3). With insufficient data to include the gear change in the model, we instead present a visual comparison of the mean catch of the two comparative tows done in 2006 (Figure \@ref(fig:net-comp)).

## Catch sorting and sampling

```{r}
post_2003_spp <- readRDS(here::here("report/mssm-appendix/post-2003-spp.rds"))
```

The most notable change to catch sorting and sampling occurred in 2003.
From 2003 to present, all species have been sorted and identified to the species or lowest taxonomic level (Rutherford et al. in prep).
Prior to 2003, `r length(post_2003_spp)` species had zero catch weights and catch counts.
Of these, six species are caught regularly: Big Skate, Sandpaper Skate, Longnose Skate, Blackbelly Eelpout, Stripetail Rockfish, and Slim Sculpin (Figure \@ref(fig:mean-catch-pre-post-2003)).

```{r mean-catch-pre-post-2003, fig.cap="Mean annual catch (kg) of fish species listed in this synoptic report that have been caught in the Multi-species small mesh survey. Grey shading highlights the period prior to full sorting and identification in 2003. The grey vertical line in 2001 indicates a change in sorting protocol where all sorting occurred below deck using a conveyor belt system (Rutherford et al. in prep).", out.width = "\\textwidth"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("report/mssm-appendix/figures/sampling-2003.png"), dpi = NA)

```

To check if some species were identified at higher taxonomic levels prior to 2003, we extracted data from GFBio for higher order taxonomies of species that have been identified in the MSSM survey since 2003 (Figure \@ref(fig:spp-aggregate-plot)).
Sculpins and skates are the main groups that were counted at the family level prior to 2003. Whereas prior to 2003, flatfishes and rockfishes appear to be identified to species if they were counted/weighed.
The abnormally high catches of eelpouts in 2002, likely reflects the transition between improved sorting just prior to full species-level identification in 2003.

```{r spp-aggregate-plot, fig.cap="Mean annual catch (kg) of higher level taxonomic identifications of species that have been caught in the Multi-species small mesh survey. Grey shading highlights the period prior to full sorting and identification in 2003. The grey vertical line in 2001 indicates a change in sorting protocol where all sorting occurred below deck using a conveyor belt system (Rutherford et al. in prep).", out.width="\\textwidth"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("report/mssm-appendix/figures/aggregated-spp-plot.png"), dpi = NA)

```

Pacific Tomcod recorded abundances decrease after 2003 and it is possible that this is the result of mis-idenfication of young pacific cod and walleye pollock prior to 2003.
However, the catch sizes of Pacific Tomcod were typically less than 5 kg/year.

```{r cod-comparison, fig.cap="Mean annual catch (kg) of Pacific Cod, Pacific Tomcod, and Walleye Pollock. Grey shading highlights the period prior to full sorting and identification in 2003.", out.width="50%"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("report/mssm-appendix/figures/sampling-cod.png"), dpi = NA)

```

## Modelling

We fit a spatiotemporal model to the MSSM data for all species that had a proportion of positive sets $\ge$ 5%.
For the six species that did not have catch weights before 2003, we calculated the proportion of positive sets for 2003 to present.
Of these species, only blackbelly eelpout met the 5% coverage threshold to be modelled.

As was done for the synoptic trawl surveys, we fit these models using a Tweedie distribution and used area swept as an offset.
In 2022, 64% of trawls (57 fishing events) did not have doorspread values and so for these fishing events we calculated the mean doorspread of 2022 and used this for the missing values.
Our spatiotemporal models had constant spatial random fields and a random walk spatiotemporal random fields.
Unlike the modelling of the synoptic trawl data, in cases where models did not converge, the spatial random field was turned off and only the spatiotmporal random field was modelled using a random walk.

We show results in the biomass index panels on the species pages and in this appendix if the models converged, the maximum estimated CIs were less than 10x the maximum estimated biomass, and the mean coefficient of variation was less than 2.

## Comparison of modelled MSSM survey indices to the MSSM design, SYN WCVI, and CPUE 3CD

The MSSM is the longest running groundfish survey on the BC coast, therefore it is important to understand how well the historical data captures trends in species abundances.
We compared the modelled MSSM survey indices to the MSSM design-based indices, modelled SYN WCVI (predicted on the SYN WCVI 2 x 2 km grid and the MSSM 3 x 3 km grid) indices, and the modelled CPUE 3CD indices.
In this appendix, where we compare the trends between different biomass indices and multiple indices are plotted on the same graph, they have been scaled to the geometric mean of estimated biomass in the years that the series overlap.
<!-- Not needed if cutting design only plot: "When plotted individually, an index is shown scaled to the geometric mean of itself."" -->

<!-- TODO: SA: isn't it just scaled to the maximum CI hits the top? -->
<!-- Not for the appendix -->

#### Modelled MSSM ~ Design-based MSSM

Trends in each species index were similar between in both the modelled and the design based MSSM indices, where the design-based index tends to be more variable (Figure \@ref(fig:mssm-model-design)).
For the species that have a design-based index, but for which models did not converge the design-based indices are included in the species pages of the report.

```{r mssm-model-design, fig.cap="Comparison of modelled (green) and design-based (pink) index from the MSSM survey. MODEL DESC NEEDED HERE? The modelled index was predicted on 3 x 3 km grid. REF GRID FIG?"}

knitr::include_graphics(here::here("report/mssm-appendix/figures/index-model-design.png"), dpi = NA)
```

#### Comparison of MSSM to other survey indices in the same region

- The MSSM index is generally more variable than the CPUE 3CD and SYN WCVI indices.
- The modelled MSSM index is most congruent with the SYN WCVI index that is predicted on the 3 x 3 km MSSM grid. (Figure - zoom-in; \@ref(fig:rolling-window-correlation))
- This is likely because the distribution of sampled depths in the the MSSM survey (81 - 219 m) are shallower than SYN WCVI samples areas deeper (43 - 803 m). (Figure \@ref(fig:depth-dist))


- The depths sampled in these surveys have been consistent over time. (needed?)


- We compared the modelled MSSM index with the modelled SYN WCVI index when predicted over the full grid of the SYN WCVI and when constrained to the same grid used for the MSSM index.


- We checked whether the correlation between the different survey indices declined as we went further back in time. We compared a 10-year rolling window correlation between the MSSM ~ CPUE 3CD, the MSSM ~ SYN WCVI, and the MSSM ~ SYN WCVI predicted on the MSSM grid.


There was no systematic decrease in correlation between the different indices earlier in the time-series (Figure \@ref(fig:rolling-window-correlation)).


### Sampling differences between MSSM and SYN WCVI

Twenty-four species have length samples in both the MSSM and SYN WCVI. Longer specimens tend to be sampled in the SYN WCVI compared to the MSSM (Figure \@ref(fig:))

There was also no relationship between the

Modelled MSSM ~ Modelled SYN WCVI (over MSSM only grid)

Modelled MSSM ~ CPUE 3CD

Modelled MSSM 2km grid ~ 3km grid

- 3km grid is less patchy
- results from the 2km grid were similar to the 3km grid --> even worth including this note?
