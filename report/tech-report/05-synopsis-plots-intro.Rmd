# Figures {#sec:synopsis-plots}

This section contains the main species-by-species data visualizations. Each
species is shown on two pages with the same layout used throughout. See
the previous 'Plot descriptions' section (Section \@ref(sec:plot-descriptions)) 
for detailed figure captions. In addition
to the figures, we also provide the scientific name, taxonomic details, DFO
species code [page in @hart1988], a link to the FishBase and WoRMS (World
Register of Marine Species) web pages, details of the most recent DFO Research
Documents and Science Advisory Reports, and any information related to
designations by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada
(COSEWIC) and to listings under the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA). The species are
ordered according to DFO species codes. The previous section
provides links to the pages sorted alphabetically by common and scientific names.
