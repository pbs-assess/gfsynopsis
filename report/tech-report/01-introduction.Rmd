# Context {#sec:context}

The combination of fishery-dependent data, such as catch and effort, and fishery-independent survey data, such as biomass indices and age compositions, form the backbone of most fisheries stock assessments.
Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) manages vast quantities of such data on groundfish species in British Columbia (BC).
However, formal stock assessments are not conducted on an annual basis for most stocks, and so much of these data are not summarized to represent the nature of the data holdings.

The groundfish data synopsis report was developed to provide a snapshot of long-term and recent population and fishing trends, as well as data availability, for all major BC groundfish species of commercial and conservation interest [@anderson2019synopsis; @anderson2020fisheries].
The report was published as a Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat (CSAS) Research Document [@anderson2019synopsis] to facilitate review of the methods, with the intent to update the report on a regular schedule.
In 2022, the first update was published as a Science Response including data up to 2021 [@synopsis2022].
In this version, we update the report to include 2022 data as well as adding several additional species, surveys, and spatiotemporal modeling of survey data. We also update referenced stock assessment Research Documents, Science Advisory Reports, and Science Responses.

# Background {#sec:background}

The groundfish data synopsis report generation is automated---pulling data from databases, fitting models, generating visualizations, and stitching the document together to facilitate rapid publication, reproducibility, and transparency.
The goals of the report are to
(1) facilitate regular review by groundfish
scientists and managers of trends in survey indices and stock composition
across all species to provide information for discussion on assessment
priorities;
(2) generate standardized datasets, biological model fits, and visualizations that will help assessment scientists develop operating models and select candidate management procedures for groundfish stocks; and
(3) increase data transparency between DFO, the fishing industry, First Nations, non-governmental organizations, and the general public.

The main figures of the synopsis report are presented in two-page species-by-species subsections that visually synthesize most available data for each species.
The report covers `r no_species` groundfish species that are either of commercial, recreational, conservation, or First Nations interest, or are regularly caught in our research surveys.
The report focuses on the surveys and data types applicable to the widest array of these species.

Each set of pages for a single species is laid out in the same format.
The page layout begins with the species common name, the species scientific name, and the DFO species code, which usually corresponds to the page number referencing the species in @hart1988.
The figures are laid out such that the first page has survey (Figure \@ref(fig:intro-maps)) time series trends and spatial patterns on the left and commercial time series by Pacific Marine Fisheries Commission areas (Figure \@ref(fig:management-map)) and spatial patterns on the right.
The second page focuses on biological samples from both fishery dependent and independent sources.
This page presents length and age data, maturity data, and an overview of available numbers of sampled fish across all survey and commercial samples.

For surveys, the report has focused on the Synoptic Bottom Trawl surveys (Figure \@ref(fig:intro-maps)), the Outside Hard Bottom Long Line (HBLL OUT) surveys, the Inside Hard Bottom Long Line surveys (HBLL INS) (Figure \@ref(fig:intro-maps)), and the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) Fishery Independent Setline surveys.
In this version, we have added data from the Multispecies Small-mesh Bottom Trawl Survey on West Coast Vancouver Island (MSSM WCVI) (formerly known as the "Shrimp Survey") as well as including length and age composition data for the Inside HBLL survey.
We show survey biomass index trends for the Hecate Strait Multispecies Assemblage (MSA HS) survey.
The report includes counts of available fish specimens from biological samples on all surveys.
A brief description of the included surveys is included in Appendix F of @anderson2019synopsis along with associated references for details on design and implementation.

(ref:intro-maps-cap) Synoptic bottom trawl survey boundaries (left) and Hard Bottom Long Line (HBLL) survey boundaries (right). 
Inside HBLL north and south are not differentiated because the delineation is not consistent from year to year. 
The International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) Fishery Independent Setline survey (FISS) locations are not shown here because they are coast-wide and are illustrated in the right panel of Figure \@ref(fig:survey-maps).
Colours match the colour coding throughout the report.

# Updates {#sec:update}

In this report, all figure pages were rebuilt with updated data using the methods described in @anderson2019synopsis, @anderson2020fisheries, and @synopsis2022.

Have we first summarize all major changes. We include methodological details on coastwide spatiotemporal survey modelling in Appendix TODO.

Updates:

* We added 2022 survey and commercial data.

* We added three species: Eulachon (*Thaleichthys pacificus*), Popeye (*Coryphaenoides cinereus*), and Shortbelly Rockfish (*Sebastes jordani*).

* We added length and age composition data for the Inside HBLL survey.

* We added data from the Multispecies Small-mesh Bottom Trawl Survey (MSSM) off West Coast Vancouver Island. We visualize biomass indices and length composition data but omit age composition data because of the rarity with which these data appear.

* We added spatiotemporal model-based biomass indices for (1) coastwide synoptic surveys, (2) coastwide Outside HBLL surveys, (3) the combined Inside HBLL surveys, (4) the IPHC FISS, and (5) the MSSM WCVI survey. This approach was originally described in @anderson2019synopsis (Appendix E and F). We expand on details of the approach in this report's Appendix TODO.

* We fixed an important erratum: the 2022 report Synoptic survey and HBLL OUT survey maps erroneously displayed data for 2018 and 2019 rather than 2020 and 2021. In this report, we confirm that the maps are displaying the intended 2021 and 2022 survey data.


## Stuff to go in appendices?

### Multispecies Small Mesh Groundfish Bottom Trawl (MSSM)

Since 1973, DFO has conducted annual surveys at fixed stations in shrimp grounds off West Coast Vancouver Island.
This survey was originally designed to collect data to assess stock status of Pink shrimp (*Pandalus jordani*) populations, but is now a multi-species survey, and is one of the longest continuous bottom trawl time-series for groundfish off the coast of WCVI.
The survey typically occurs in late April to May with exceptions in 1985 (May 24--June 7) and in 1987 (August 4--14).
Since 1973, changes to the fishing gear used and changes to catch sorting may affect interpretation of the data.
Trawl nets were changed in 1976, 2005, and 2006. And notably, catch sorting has changed as follows:
  - From 1973 - 1976, large species weights were estimated using random sampling
  - Since 1978 large fish were sorted and weighed
  - Since 2001 all species, including small species were sorted and weighed

The most up to date data for the MSSM is found in GFBio and is publicly available on the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS) Flemming R (2013) TODO REF. Additional survey details can be found in Rutherford et al. (in prep) TODO REF.

### Spatial modelling

- A single model was fit to the combined data from each type of survey.
- Model-based indices were fit and are presented when the total proportion of positive sets across a survey type was >= 5%.
- Due to the higher variability in sampling done off the West Coast Haida Gwaii (WCHG) and deeper depth strata?, when the proportion of postive sets in WCHG was < 5% it was omitted.
- The expected biomass density was predicted over the combined survey grid.
- For the IPHC FISS, the spatial grid of sampling stations from 2017 was used for predictions. The grid from 2017 represents a standard sampling grid, which matches the survey domain of the majority of the IPHC FISS data (e.g., unlike the 2018 expansion year). Similar to the IPHC design-based index only stations declared as usable and standard (REF?)
- Difference from 2019: we used nbinom2 for HBLL and IPHC surveys.
- I said that we stitched for >= 5% but we don't include if model didn't fit
- Mesh cutoff: 20 for all surveys
-`formula = catch ~ 1, family = tweedie or nbinom2, time = "year", spatiotemporal = "rw", spatial = "on"`
- Offset for IPHC was log(effSkate * hook_adjust_factor) with ICR method
- Offset for HBLL is now (remember to empty HBLL stitched caches) log(hook_count / hook_adjust_factor) with ICR method
- Offset for SYN was log(area_swept / 1e5)

<!-- From 999-survey-index.Rmd -->
We can then calculate area-weighted expected biomass $B_t$ in year $t$ as:

TODO

<!-- \begin{equation} -->
<!-- B_t = \sum_{j = 1}^{n_j} -->
<!--   w_j \cdot \exp \left( \bm{X}_{j,t} \bm{\beta} + \omega_j + \epsilon_{j,t} \right), -->
<!-- \end{equation} -->

where $j$ references a 2 km $\times$ 2 km grid cell within the survey domain
and $w_j$ represents the weight or area of that grid cell (4 km^2^). 
In other words, we sum the predicted biomass
across all grid cells within the survey domain for each year. We generated
standard errors on the annual estimates of log biomass via the generalized
Delta method as implemented in TMB [@kristensen2016].

### IPHC update

The methods for calculating the IPHC design-based index remain unchanged from those described in @anderson2019synopsis and (DFO 2022 - Synopsis TODO REF), except for the following:

1. Species identification has improved over time for some species. For example, the average catch rate of 'Unidentified Skates' was almost 1 fish per effective skate from 1995–1999, but then declined to near zero because Big Skate and Longnose Skate were both explicitly identified from 1998 onwards. The more rarely caught Aleutian Skate and Sandpaper Skate only shows up in the data from 2006 onwards. Such changes in protocol can be the cause of zero counts early in the time series for some species and so these data points have been omitted. See [HG predator analysis vignette](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/pbs-assess/gfiphc/blob/master/vignettes/analysis_for_HG_herring_predators.html). Similarly the Shortspine Thornyhead only shows up in the data in 1998 and was likely classified under 'Unidentified Thornyhead (idiot)'.

2. Similar to 2021, in 2022 waters off the WCVI were surveyed but only for a subsample of stations. This may affect the determination of whether or not Series AB can be considered representative of the full coast and is one reason why a model-based index may be preferable.

## Erratum

The 2022 report Survey Biomass Maps for the Synoptic Bottom Trawl Surveys displayed data and model estimates for 2018 and 2019 rather than 2020 and 2021.
