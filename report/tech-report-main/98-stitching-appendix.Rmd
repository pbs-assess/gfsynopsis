# Standardizing Commercial Catch Rate Data with Spatiotemporal Models {#app:cpue}

We used spatiotemporal models to standardize bottom trawl commercial catch per unit effort (CPUE). 
In previous versions of this report, we had used a non-spatial GLMM approach [@anderson2019synopsis].

We fit our models with Poisson-link delta models [@thorson2018poisson].
These delta or hurdle models contain two linked component models, more formally called "linear predictors".
For any one linear predictor, we can represent the spatiotemporal model as:

\begin{align}
\mathbb{E}[y_{\boldsymbol{s},t}] &= \mu_{\boldsymbol{s},t},\\
\mu_{\boldsymbol{s},t} &=
\exp \left( \eta_{\boldsymbol{s}, t} \right),\\
\eta_{\boldsymbol{s}, t} &=
\boldsymbol{X}_{\boldsymbol{s},t} \boldsymbol{\beta} +
\gamma_v +
\omega_{\boldsymbol{s}} +
\delta_{\boldsymbol{s},t}
\end{align}

Here, the expected value, $\mathbb{E}[y_{\boldsymbol{s},t}]$, of response
variable $y_{\boldsymbol{s},t}$ (catch weight) at spatial coordinates $\boldsymbol{s}$ and time
(year) $t$ is the mean at that point in space and time, given by $\mu_{\boldsymbol{s},t}$.
That mean then formed by an inverse link function applied to the linear predictor $\eta_{\boldsymbol{s},t}$.
The linear predictor is comprised of 
a vector of main effect covariates $\boldsymbol{X}_{\boldsymbol{s},t}$ multiplied by a vector of coefficients $\boldsymbol{\beta}$,
a random intercept for vessel $v$ ($\gamma_v$),
a spatial Gaussian random field value $\omega_{\boldsymbol{s}}$, and
a spatiotemporal value $\delta_{\boldsymbol{s},t}$.

<!-- and an "offset" $O_{\boldsymbol{s},t}$. -->
<!-- The offset is effectively a covariate with a coefficient fixed at 1 and allows us to control for (log) hours fished. -->

The spatial Gaussian Markov random field is assumed to be drawn from a multivariate normal (MVN) distribution with covariance (inverse precision) matrix $\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{\omega}$ constrained by a Mat√©rn covariance function.

\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\omega} \sim \operatorname{MVNormal} (\boldsymbol{0}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{\omega}).
\end{equation}

The spatiotemporal portion is structured as annual independent draws from a Gaussian Markov random field:

\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\epsilon_{t}} \sim \operatorname{MVNormal} \left(\boldsymbol{0}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{\epsilon} \right).
\end{equation}

The main effect coefficients varied by available data.
For cases with data for 9 or greater months, we fit a model with a mean for each year, a quadratic effect of depth, and a penalized cyclical smoother for month.
For cases with data for fewer than 9 months, we fit the same model but replaced the cyclical smoother with independent means for each month.

We chose Poisson-link [@thorson2018poisson] delta-lognormal models.
In these models, the linear predictors in link (log) space ($\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$) represent theoretical group number $n$ and theoretical catch per group $w$:

\begin{align}
\log (n) &= \eta_1,\\
\log (w) &= \eta_2.
\end{align}

These get transformed [@thorson2018poisson] as

\begin{align}
p &= 1 - \exp(- a \cdot n),\\
r &= \frac{n w}{p},
\end{align}

where Eq. A.8 has its roots in a Poisson process (and the 'cloglog' link) and the probabilities $p$ and positive rates $r$ are modelled as Bernoulli and lognormal, respectively. The symbol $a$ represents the area swept for a given tow.

We implemented these models using the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approximation to Gaussian random fields with Gaussian Markov random fields [@lindgren2011] for computational efficiency using the R [@r2023] package sdmTMB [@anderson2022sdmTMB].
sdmTMB estimates the marginal log likelihood using TMB to integrate over random effects with the Laplace approximation [@kristensen2016].
This SPDE approach requires creating finite-element triangulation "meshes" for SPDE calculations and to interpolate from the random effects to the data locations or prediction locations with bilinear interpolation [@lindgren2011].
We constructed our meshes with the fmesher R package [@fmesher].

We retained the same approach to defining the data representing a "fleet" for a given species as in @anderson2019synopsis, but applied these criteria only to generating a coastwide fleet (region specific indices are described below).
These criteria included retaining all vessels that 
had at least 100 tows that were positive for a given species and
had at least 5 years with 5 trips that were positive for a given species.

We attempted to fit our models to all species with at least 200 rows of data given the fleet definition.
We omitted models that did not pass convergence criteria. To assess convergence, we checked that the Hessian was positive definite, that the maximum absolute marginal log likelihood gradient was $<$ 0.001 with respect to all fixed effects, and that no Gaussian random field marginal standard deviation was approaching a boundary (interpreted as ensuring their standard deviations were $>$ 0.01).

From our fitted models, we calculated an area-weighted biomass index by predicting density from our model across a grid, multiplying that density by grid cell area, and summing the resulting biomass across grid cells [e.g., @thorson2015].
We defined the grid as the intersection between the full synoptic survey 2 $\times$ 2 km grid and all commercial trawl locations for a given species fleet. I.e., only grid cells with at least one fishing event for a given species fleet were included.
We created region-specific standardized indices (i.e., for 5CDE, and 5AB, and 3CD) by partitioning the prediction grid by the given regions.
