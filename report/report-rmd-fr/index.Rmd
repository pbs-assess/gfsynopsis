abstract: |
  The combination of fishery-dependent data, such as catch and effort, and
  fishery-independent survey data, such as biomass indices and age
  compositions, forms the backbone of most fisheries stock assessments. For
  British Columbia groundfish, vast quantities of such data are
  collected annually, with 100% at-sea observer coverage, 100% dockside
  monitoring of landings, and deployment of multiple trawl, trap, and
  hook-and-line surveys. However, there is not the capacity to conduct formal
  stock assessments for most stocks annually, and therefore, much of these data
  are not summarized to represent the nature of the data holdings.
  Here, we introduce a reproducible report to give a snapshot of population and
  fishing trends, growth and maturity patterns, as well as data availability,
  for 113 groundfish species in British Columbia. The report generation is
  fully automated -- pulling data from databases, fitting models, generating
  visualizations, and stitching the document together to facilitate frequent
  publication, reproducibility, and transparency. Our goals are (1) to
  facilitate regular review by groundfish scientists and managers of trends in
  survey indices and stock composition; (2) to generate standardized datasets
  and visualizations that will help assessment scientists develop operating
  models and select candidate management procedures as part of a planned
  management-procedure framework for groundfish stocks; and (3) to increase
  data transparency between Fisheries and Oceans Canada, the fishing industry,
  non-governmental organizations, and the public.
