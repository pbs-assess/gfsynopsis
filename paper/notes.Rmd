Start broader, discuss challenges of and value of data visualization in general.
Narrow in on what we did, flow from databases to R packages to the paper. Show 
two figures - one for each species page from the synopsis report.

# Journal ideas:
1. Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Science - rapid communication
- 2 figure limit
- 2500 words

1. Fisheries Research - short communication (not technical communication)
- no figure limit
- ~6 page limit (doesn't appear to be strictly enforced; eg. some with 8 pages)

...

1. PLoS One
-  few, if any, restrictions

# Thoughts on how to frame the paper:
1. Put in framework of complexity of systems (particularly marine). Discuss
ability to detect environmental or stock changes (eg. climate change, stock
status) quickly and respond quickly. Focus more broadly, not only narrowly as
in a few intense stock assessments, but more broadly monitor many species in 
many ways. (see Hilborn reference 1970's)

1. Frame in context of high volumes of data, with increasing sensor technology,
drone surveys, collecting vast quantities of data. Problematic to look at all of
these data. Tie into movement towards open data/open science/transparency.
Openness is about more than just data availablity, but is also about 
summarizing the data in a digestable way.

Perhaps frame in context of vast amounts of data, with discussion on
applicability to the issue of visualizing data quickly to be able to detect
and quickly respond to any changes.

In addition, communicate what we've learned along the way. 

Uses:
- new staff coming up to speed with summaries of what the data are and what the
data mean
- at meetings about individual species - good overview of stocks and data 
availability
- facilitate discussions between managers and scientists about priorities 
(visual tool to show stock and biological trends relevant to discussion)
- rapid detection of data issues (that may go unseen and into assessments/research)
- engaging data gathering partners, stakeholders, funding sources - showcase
the data to participants, strengthen relationships with industry (show them 
where their money is going, that the data are being used and not sitting away
in a database)
- useful tools for stock assessment and other research; good first glance when
deciding approaches, what data are available for modelling, analysis, etc.
- standardize process of data extraction and summarizing
- identify data gaps for directing research efforts/funding
