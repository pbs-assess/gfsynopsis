# Abstract

Modern survey and fishery observation programs generate vast quantities of data;
however, regulatory agencies often lack the capacity to translate this data into
effective and broad monitoring. Here, we describe an automated report for 113
groundfish species in Pacific Canadian waters to encourage others to consider
similar reports for their own data. Our report includes standardized
visualizations of commercial and survey population trends in time and space, age
and length frequencies, maturity, and growth. It facilitates discussions on
stock-assessment and survey prioritization, increases transparency about data
holdings, and makes the data available for regular review by interested
parties.

# Introduction

Modern survey and fishery observation programs generate vast quantities of
biological and environmental data; however, turning that data into effective
monitoring remains a challenge. Agencies that collect data often lack the
resources to report on all facets of it in a timely fashion. Typically,
detailed stock assessments report on data for only a small subset of species.
While such focused analyses are required for management of some stocks, broad
monitoring programs across an array of species and data types are essential to
detecting ecological surprises and "unknown unknowns" [@hilborn1987;
@wintle2010]. As part of a movement toward open data [e.g., @canada2018], many
raw data sets, including those collected by government agencies, are now made
available. However, processing and visualizing those data sets requires
domain-specific knowledge (e.g., about sampling protocols), advanced skills
(e.g., data management, population modelling, computer programming), and time.
Collectively, these factors often limit the ability for interested parties to
derive meaningful insights.

In British Columbia (BC), Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) faces these
problems in monitoring its groundfish populations and fisheries. In BC,
government groundfish scientists hold the potential responsibility of providing
science advice on over 100 species. The commercial groundfish fleet is subject
to 100% on-board and dockside monitoring, while numerous fisheries-independent
trawl and longline surveys are conducted annually, producing large quantities
of valuable data [@stanley2015]. At the same time, assessment scientists face
limitations in personnel and time. As a result, most stocks are not regularly
examined through stock assessment, leaving the majority of monitoring data
unreported. Although the Canadian government is engaged in an open-data
initiative [@canada2018], some of DFO's data holdings cannot be shared due to
privacy laws. Furthermore, the data that are shared are not easily digested
without advanced data processing skills and extensive knowledge of the survey
programs and commercial fisheries.

Automated visualization and reporting is one solution to these problems. Data
visualization can serve as much more than just an endpoint to data
analysis---it can serve as a critical component of the scientific process
[@fox2011]. Visualization can facilitate rapid understanding of data, engage
stakeholders, and raise awareness of data gaps. Visualization can also serve as
a tool for those with domain-specific knowledge to spot errors in data sets.
Furthermore, compared to the structured nature of statistical models, the
unconstrained nature of visualization helps detect the unexpected
[@wickham2015]. The advancement of the family of data analysis packages for the
statistical software R [@r2019], such as knitr [@xie2017], makes it
increasingly practical to generate reproducible visualization reports of survey
and fishery monitoring data.

As part of a solution to our above-mentioned challenges, we developed an
automated data synopsis report for 113 groundfish species in BC, Canada.
Here we share our approach to encourage others to consider
similar reports for their own data. Our goals with the report were manifold and
included (1) ensuring that the current state of knowledge on indices of
abundance for all groundfish stocks are available for regular review by DFO
scientists, managers, and all interested parties, (2) facilitating discussions
related to stock-assessment and survey-program prioritization, (3) increasing
transparency about our data holdings, and (4) producing standardized tools,
derived data sets, and visualizations that are useful elsewhere, such as in
stock assessments.

# Methods

We focused our groundfish synopsis report on species of commercial,
recreational, conservation, or First Nations interest, and those regularly
caught in DFO surveys. We included population trends and biological data from
commercial fisheries and scientific surveys; this gave an overall snapshot of
available information for each species. Of the fisheries-independent surveys
that DFO conducts, we presented data from those that provided the greatest
spatial and taxonomic coverage of the species. We chose to focus on aspects of
the data that were most important to stock assessment, and display both spatial
and temporal aspects of the data.

In designing the report we made the following design considerations:
(1) Maintain a consistent layout for all species, including empty plots to
   emphasize a lack of data for some species.
(2) Limit the report to two pages per species so that all data for one species
   could be viewed at once.
(3) Focus on data types relevant to the most species.
(4) Group similarly focused visualizations together.
(5) Display metadata alongside visualizations where possible.
(6) Maintain consistent colour meaning throughout (e.g. data from a given survey
   always uses the same colour) and use colourblind-proof colours where
   possible.
(7) Describe the visualizations in detail at the beginning of the report so that
   the species pages are mostly visual.
(8) Highlight uncertainty wherever possible (e.g. through shading to indicate
   periods of increased uncertainty in reported catches).

We aimed to make the report automated and reproducible so that it could be
easily updated in the future. We also wanted the report production to be
transparent and traceable with regards to how the data were extracted from
databases and treated prior to plotting. To accomplish this, we developed
a family of R packages that facilitated extraction of data from relational
databases, tidying and arranging the necessary data for modelling or plotting,
fitting statistical models, plotting the data and statistical models, and
compiling the visualizations into a report format. We wrote code in a modular
format so that individual functions could be used for other purposes---for
example, so the data could be extracted and biological models fit for stock
assessments in a consistent, standardized way.

We settled on presenting visualizations of (1) trends in time and space for
fisheries-independent surveys and commercial fisheries catch and catch per unit
effort (CPUE), (2) temporal trends in length and age frequencies, and (3)
biological parameters including length at age, weight at length, age at
maturity, length at maturity, and maturity frequencies from
fisheries-independent surveys and commercial data sources. We additionally
chose to visualize a summary of counts of available biological data (ages,
ageing structures such as otoliths, lengths, weights, and maturities) for all
commercial and research samples.

Throughout report development we solicited feedback from stakeholders and other
potential users of the report on data to include as well as on report structure
and design. We also sought feedback from data experts for various species
groups to ensure that the data being captured were accurate, complete, and
presented faithfully.

# Results

The report includes two pages of visualization for 113 species of BC groundfish
and sharks [@anderson2019synopsis]. Figures 1 and 2 show the pages for an
example species. The species covered include 34 rockfish species; 16
elasmobranch species and one chimaera species; 16 flatfish species; nine
gadiform species (cods); 15 sculpin and poacher species; three
greenling/lingcod species; six eelpout species, three prickleback species, and
seven other perciform species; and one species each of smelt, sablefish and
snailfish. The visualizations for many data-limited species include mostly
empty plots, which graphically demonstrate the lack of data. This effectively
turns unknown unknowns about a given species [@wintle2010] into *known*
unknowns. For data-rich species, nearly all data available are visualized
together on two pages for the first time.

# Discussion

We have described an automated report that presents up-to-date population
trends and biological data from both commercial fisheries and research surveys
for groundfish in BC, Canada. Stock assessments are not available for most of
these species, and are not available every year for most that are assessed,
limiting the dissemination of these data. Our report facilitates the broad
monitoring of groundfish populations in BC waters---it ensures all BC
groundfish scientists, managers, and interested parties have access to
consistent, up-to-date, and easily digestible visualizations of data holdings.
The report increases transparency, provides a mechanism for regular review of
data for indication of surprises by relevant parties, and facilitates
discussions concerning stock-assessment and survey-program prioritization.

The production of our groundfish data synopsis report is automated---from data
extraction to report generation. This is only possible because of the carefully
organized and maintained relational databases housing DFO groundfish commercial
and survey data. This report and its data-to-document workflow demonstrate the
value of investing in the development and ongoing maintenance of organized
databases for any agency collecting and housing large quantities of data [e.g.
@michener2012]. Knowledge of, and accessibility to, available data within an
agency is fundamentally important. The functions we created to extract
groundfish data for the report are available within our organization for those
requiring access to the databases, and facilitate internally reviewed,
standardized, and consistent data extraction methods.

Unlike detailed species-specific analyses conducted in stock assessments, we
liken our report to window shopping. Our report gives a quick flavour of the
available data for a given stock and hints at possible indices of relative
population trends. However, the outputs in this report are not a substitute for
species-specific stock assessment. For example, stock assessments may use
different data sources than are presented in the report, analyze data on a
stock-by-stock basis, and make considerations for special cases that we do not
consider. Furthermore, relative biomass indices based on survey or commercial
CPUE data in the report require careful, species-specific interpretation as they
may not accurately represent abundance trends for some stocks. For example,
biomass indices may be based on surveys with particularly low catchability for
certain species.

We suggest that a similar approach would have broad utility across taxonomic
groups, regions, and types of data. A similar approach could be useful nearly
anywhere agencies face monitoring multiple elements (e.g., populations,
species, ecosystems, or environmental processes) with relevant data maintained
in databases [e.g., @ricard2013]. The approach would be most useful for
agencies that lack the capacity to assess those elements in great depth at
a frequency that meets management needs. However, even with regular detailed
assessments, such a report can provide a broad overview in a format consistent
across all elements. Furthermore, similar approaches have been used to
facilitate completion of stock assessments---for example, in automating the
output of complex models and producing the assessment document under tight
deadlines [@berger2019hake]. Although we caution that it can take considerable
work to set up such a workflow, the approach can yield substantial efficiency
gains in future years.

Thus far, the response to our report from stakeholders, managers, and other
groundfish scientists has been positive [@dfo2019synopsis]. Internally, the
report has become an indispensable reference for individuals providing science
advice on groundfish in the region and the tools used to generate the report
proved useful in a recent Pacific cod (*Gadus macrocephalus*) assessment for
the coast of BC [@forrest2019pcod] and in many ongoing projects. We plan to
update the report to include new data on an annual or biennial basis with
larger structural changes on a less frequent basis. Future plans include adding
visualizations of relevant climate data such as local climate velocities [e.g.,
@loarie2009] and indicators of localized range shifts. We hope our approach can
serve as a template for other regions and species groups---as one of many
tools---to turn survey and fisheries data into effective broad monitoring.
