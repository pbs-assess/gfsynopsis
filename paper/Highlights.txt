Modern survey and fishery observation programs generate large quantities of data.
However, much of those data often remain unseen.
We describe an automated visualization approach for over 100 groundfish species.
The approach aides monitoring, stock-assessment prioritization, and data review.
We encourage others to consider similar approaches for their own data.
