Benefit,Example
Assembles all data for all species in one place in a common format,Assists rapid prototyping of operating models and proposing candidate data-based management procedures
,Assists parameterizing ecosystem models
,Provides a quick reference when initiating or reviewing any stock assessment
,
"Many visualizations in a tight space encourages comparison across data sets","All fisheries dependent and independent index trends can be compared for similarities and contrasts"
,"Spatial and temporal trends can be considered simultaneously"
,
Promotes regular review of survey trends for all species,Noticing recent declines in multiple survey indices for a stock with no planned assessment
,Can assist discussions of stock assessment prioritization
,
"Builds trust between contributors of data and government agency",Industry associations that have contributed time or money to survey programs can see their data being used
,Data collected with tax-payer funds are not left hidden on internal government servers
,
Makes data interpretable to all interested parties,"Unlike internal tools, makes visualized data available to public, Indigenous people, NGOs, fishing industry, fishery managers, consultants"
,"Open data is not enough---many interested parties lack the skills, time, and institutional knowledge to turn raw data into interpretable graphics"
,Ensures data have been interpreted appropriately and with caveats by those with institutional knowledge
,
Highlights data richness and data poverty,"Assists with discussions of survey data prioritization, e.g., aging-structure collection priorities"
,Makes known unknowns clear
,
Identifies data anomalies,Detecting consistent deviations in survey indices across stocks indicating historical deviations from survey design
,Detecting fish lengths entered in wrong units
,
Data extraction process has been peer-reviewed,Allows for rapid data extraction and sharing with collaborators
