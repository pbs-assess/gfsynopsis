Benefit,Example
Assembles all data for all species in one place in a common format,Assists rapid prototyping of operating models and proposing candidate data-based management procedures
,Assists parameterizing ecosystem models
,Provides a quick reference when initiating or reviewing any stock assessment
,
"Many visualizations in close proximity encourages comparison across data sets","Allows comparisons of all fisheries dependent and independent index trends for
similarities and contrasts"
,"Allows simultaneous consideration of spatial and temporal trends"
,"Inspires new research ideas"
,
Promotes regular review of survey trends for all species,"Shows recent declines in multiple survey indices for stocks with no planned assessment"
,Assists in discussions of stock assessment prioritization
,
"Builds trust between contributors of data and government agency","Allows industry association that have contributed time or money to survey programs to see how their data is being used"
,"Ensures data collected with tax-payer funds are not left hidden on internal government servers"
,
Makes data interpretable to all interested parties,"Makes visualized data available to public, Indigenous people, NGOs, fishing industry, fishery managers, consultants"
,"Turns raw data into interpretable graphics for interested parties lacking the skills, time, and institutional knowledge to do this with available data (i.e., open data is not enough)"
,Ensures data have been interpreted appropriately and with caveats by those with institutional knowledge
,
Highlights data richness and data poverty,"Assists with discussions of survey data prioritization (e.g., aging-structure collection priorities)"
,Makes known unknowns clear
,
Identifies data anomalies,"Shows consistent deviations in survey indices across stocks that indicate historical deviations from survey design"
,"Allows detection of fish lengths entered in wrong units"
