# Science Editor's Comments to Author {-}

I agree with both reviewers that your manuscript will be a useful and
interesting article for readers of Fisheries. However, unlike the first
reviewer, I do think some revisions are needed, but, unlike the second reviewer,
I would consider these to be minor rather than major. I have included my
editorial comments along with those of both reviewers.  Please look all of them
over and indicate whether or not you incorporated them into your revised
manuscript. For instances in which you chose not to incorporate a suggestion,
please provide a brief explanation of your reasons.

**We thank the editor for their positive comments. Please see below for our
responses to the reviewers' comments.**

When you revise your manuscript please highlight the changes you make in the
manuscript by using the track changes mode in MS Word or by using bold or
coloured text.

**Please see the file diff.pdf, which shows the differences. TODO: Unless you (Sean)
have another method, I'll save and commit the .tex file for the submitted version. Then
''latexdiff paper-subm-fisheries.tex paper.tex diff.tex'' creates a .tex file that can be
latex'ed -- it nicely shows up the differences.**

Comments to the Author

James Ianelli

This short paper highlights a much needed practice in global
fisheries---improvements in transparency on data availability and presentation
aspects. I like that it focuses attention on a data report without sacrificing
valuable pages in a journal like yours.

**We thank the reviewer for his encouraging review.**

There were some minor points that could be addressed.

1) They emphasize throughout the document the multispecies nature of the
work. This is certainly true in the broad sense of including many species
plotted out in the same way, but each ''view'' (visualization) is single
species. To avoid confusion with what a multispecies presentation might look
like (with more than one species in a visualization), this wording might be
modified.

**TODO We only say 'multi-species' twice, including the title. Andy tried adding in
``Given the large amount of data it was necessary to visualize data independently
for each of the multiple species. Our general approach could certainly be used
to view related species in single visualizations.'' (in this commit, end of
paragraph 9). But it sounds overly defensive.
Maybe best just to change the title to**

**``Reproducible visualization of raw fisheries data for 113 species improves transparency, assessment efficiency, and monitoring''**

**I think we weren't keen on that version at some point, but may be the simplest
way to address Jim's point, which is fairly valid. And avoids getting tangled up
with explaining why multi-species isn't quite multi-speces.**

2) The introduction extolls the virtues of visualizations for communication and
summarizations. I'm a big fan. However, there are some cases where flashy
visualizations are misleading and exaggerate trends and spatial patterns. While
I think the authors do a fantastic job of highlighting sample sizes etc., more
mention of the issue and how they address it could be made.

3) I would like to have seen more text on how to shoehorn this type of graphical
presentation into a different setting outside of PBS/DFO’s system.

4) The main document (Anderson et al. 2019) is great. I was interested to see
that there was an accessibility (for vision impaired etc.) link at the bottom of
the website. Before seeing that I was curious if something mentioning how a
vision impaired person might find such graphics useful?
Within the US, ''alt-text'' is meant to be used which describes what’s in a
particular figure. This sounds like a big task for this type of
presentation. But perhaps this could be brought out in the discussion
somewhat. Specifically, another movement is to have visualizations also having
direct links to the underlying data ... which might be another advancement in
future.

GENERAL COMMENTS

The proposed article is relevant, in a theme that must be addressed not only
from the scientific perspective, but also involving the users of the
resources. Results and maps presented thought-provoking, but its interpretation
is not simple, requires a degree of experience, and as separate illustrations
should be designed so that they can be interpreted just to see them, which does
not happen in the case.

As a result of the review I consider that the document should be improved to
achieve a clear structure in contents (in my opinion there are texts not located
in the corresponding section), strengthen the methodology (currently contains
information that should be passed to the introduction and a series of the
authors' considerations when developing the work, without considering how it was
done) and improve discussion is essential. The above to achieve internal
consistency and meet the objectives set by the authors themselves.

SPECIFIC COMMENTS

1. The adstract mentions that visualizations should serve as a critical
   component of the scientific process and facilitate the understanding and
   commitment of the participants. However, these points are not taken into
   account because the illustrations require strengthening to be easily
   understood, there is no talk of the opinion of the users in the design of the
   exits, there was no paragraph found that illustrates with the visualizations
   can give rise to raise scientific questions.

2. Examples of visualizations are mentioned in the introduction, however this
background is not used to discuss, compare and conclude about the work done. It
seems to me that this should be considered to strengthen the discussion, and
perhaps to defend the strengths of the proposal in this document.

3.The first two paragraphs of the methodology can be used to close the
introduction (lines 85-96). In the following paragraphs of this section we do
not find how it was done, rather all the design approaches and
considerations. In that sense, for non-experts on the subject it would be very
useful to strengthen this chapter, perhaps this is simple if a diagram or figure
that synthesizes is used.

4.The discussion seems internal. It aims to explain results, considerations and
propose new ideas to improve this work. However there is no discussion with
other similar systems. For example, what is proposed in Australia is very
educational, easy to understand for all public, very visual; but on the other
hand it does not have the scope of what is proposed. What I can see of ICES does
not have the quality and complexity of what you present in this
document. Perhaps some paragraphs in this area would result in a relevant
academic discussion.
