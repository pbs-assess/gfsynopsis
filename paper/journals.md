Fisheries Research: A Short Communication is a concise but complete description of a limited investigation, which will not be included in a later paper. Short Communications should be as completely documented, both by reference to the literature and description of the experimental procedures employed, as a regular paper. They should not occupy more than 6 printed pages (about 12 manuscript pages, including figures, tables and references).

Fish and Fisheries?
'Ghoti' forum contributions
'Ghoti' is a forum section for publishing stimulating commentary and opinion. (The name derives from George Bernard Shaw's joke spelling of 'fish' - 'gh' as in 'rough', 'o' as in 'women' and 'ti' as in 'palatial'.)
Ghoti articles are generally shorter than regular submissions and will be selected, edited and subject to the normal peer review.
